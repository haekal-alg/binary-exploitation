1. The GOT is a _massive_ table of addresses; these addresses are the **actual locations** in memory of the `libc` functions. 
	1. Example, `puts@got` will contain the address of `puts` in memory.
2. When the PLT gets called, it reads the GOT address and redirects execution there.
3. As the GOT is part of the binary, it will always be a **constant offset** away from the base.
4. Calling the PLT entry of a function is the same as calling the function itself.
